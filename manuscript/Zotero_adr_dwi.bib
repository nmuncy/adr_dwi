  abstract = {In the United States over 1.7 million cases of traumatic brain injury are reported yearly, but predictive correlation of cellular injury to impact tissue strain is still lacking, particularly for neuronal injury resulting from compression. Given the prevalence of compressive deformations in most blunt head trauma, this information is critically important for the development of future mitigation and diagnosis strategies. Using a 3D in vitro neuronal compression model, we investigated the role of impact strain and strain rate on neuronal lifetime, viability, and pathomorphology. We find that strain magnitude and rate have profound, yet distinctively different effects on the injury pathology. While strain magnitude affects the time of neuronal death, strain rate influences the pathomorphology and extent of population injury. Cellular injury is not initiated through localized deformation of the cytoskeleton but rather driven by excess strain on the entire cell. Furthermore we find that, mechanoporation, one of the key pathological trigger mechanisms in stretch and shear neuronal injuries, was not observed under compression.},

Consequences vary from mild cognitive impairment to death and, no matter the severity of subsequent sequelae, it represents a high burden for affected patients and for the health care system. Brain trauma can cause neuronal death through mechanical forces that disrupt cell architecture, and other secondary consequences through mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, programmed cell death, and, most importantly, excitotoxicity. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the many classical and novel pathways implicated in tissue damage following TBI.

  abstract = {Concussions present with a myriad of symptomatic and cognitive concerns; however, the relationship between these functional disruptions and the underlying changes in the brain are not yet well understood. Hubs, or brain regions that are connected to many different functional networks, may be specifically disrupted after concussion. Given the implications in concussion research, we quantified hub disruption within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other brain networks. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from collegiate student-athletes (n\,=\,44) at three time points: baseline (before beginning their athletic season), acute post-injury (approximately 48h after a diagnosed concussion), and recovery (after starting return-to-play progression, but before returning to contact). We used self-reported symptoms and computerized cognitive assessments collected across similar time points to link these functional connectivity changes to clinical outcomes. Concussion resulted in increased connectivity between regions within the DMN compared with baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more positively related to symptoms and more negatively related to visual memory performance compared with baseline and recovery. Further, concussion led to decreased connectivity between DMN hubs and visual network non-hubs relative to baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more negatively related to somatic symptoms and more positively related to visual memory performance compared with baseline and recovery. Relationships between functional connectivity, symptoms, and cognition were not significantly different at baseline versus recovery. These results highlight a unique relationship between self-reported symptoms, visual memory performance, and acute functional connectivity changes involving DMN hubs after concussion in athletes. This may provide evidence for a disrupted balance of within- and between-network communication highlighting possible network inefficiencies after concussion. These results aid in our understanding of the pathophysiological disruptions after concussion and inform our understanding of the associations between disruptions in brain connectivity and specific clinical presentations acutely post-injury.}

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging is highly sensitive to the microstructural integrity of the brain and has uncovered significant abnormalities following traumatic brain injury not appreciated through other methods. It is hoped that this increased sensitivity will aid in the detection and prognostication in patients with traumatic injury. However, the pathological substrates of such changes are poorly understood. Specifically, decreases in fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor imaging are consistent with axonal injury, myelin injury or both in white matter fibres. In contrast, in both humans and animal models, increases in fractional anisotropy have been suggested to reflect axonal regeneration and plasticity, but the direct histological evidence for such changes remains tenuous. We developed a method to quantify the anisotropy of stained histological sections using Fourier analysis, and applied the method to a rat controlled cortical impact model to identify the specific pathological features that give rise to the diffusion tensor imaging changes in subacute to chronic traumatic brain injury. A multiple linear regression was performed to relate the histological measurements to the measured diffusion tensor changes. The results show that anisotropy was significantly increased (P\,\&lt;\,0.001) in the perilesioned cortex following injury. Cortical anisotropy was independently associated (standardized {$\beta$}\,=\,0.62, P\,=\,0.04) with the coherent organization of reactive astrocytes (i.e. gliosis) and was not attributed to axons. By comparison, a decrease in white matter anisotropy (P\,\&lt;\,0.001) was significantly related to demyelination ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.75, P\,=\,0.0015) and to a lesser extent, axonal degeneration ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.48, P\,=\,0.043). Gliosis within the lesioned cortex also influenced diffusion tensor tractography, highlighting the fact that spurious tracts in the injured brain may not necessarily reflect continuous axons and may instead depict glial scarring. The current study demonstrates a novel method to relate pathology to diffusion tensor imaging findings, elucidates the underlying mechanisms of anisotropy changes following traumatic brain injury and significantly impacts the clinical interpretation of diffusion tensor imaging findings in the injured brain.}

Despite its predominance in the EEG signal, large variations can be observed in alpha properties during development, with an increase in alpha frequency over childhood and adulthood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these changes in alpha rhythm are related to the maturation of visual white matter pathways. We capitalized on a large diffusion MRI (dMRI)-EEG dataset (dMRI n = 2,747, EEG n = 2,561) of children and adolescents of either sex (age range, 5--21 years old) and showed that maturation of the optic radiation specifically accounts for developmental changes of alpha frequency. Behavioral analyses also confirmed that variations of alpha frequency are related to maturational changes in visual perception. The present findings demonstrate the close link between developmental variations in white matter tissue properties, electrophysiological responses, and behavior.},

In the present study, 17 miniature swine were subjected to nonimpact inertial brain injury. At 3 hours (h), 6 h, 24 h, 3 days, 7 days, and 10 days post-trauma, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine axonal accumulation of NF-light (NF-L), the rod and sidearm domains and sidearm phosphorylation states of NF-medium (NF-M), and heavy (NF-H). We found that NF-L accumulation was easily identified in damaged axons by 6 h post-trauma, but NF-M and H accumulation was not clearly visualized until 3 days following injury. In addition, the axonal accumulation of NF-M and H appeared to be primarily comprised of the sidearm domains. While the accumulating NF was found to be predominantly dephosphorylated, we also detected accumulation of phosphorylated NR Finally, we found that developing axonal pathology may proceed either towards axotomy with discrete terminal bulb formation or towards the development of varicose swellings encompassing long portions ofaxons. These findings suggest that there is a differential temporal course in NF subtype disassembly, dephosphorylation, and accumulation in axons following initial brain trauma and that these processes occur in morphologically distinct phenotypes of maturing axonal pathology.}

  abstract = {Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is observed commonly in traumatically brain injured humans. However, traditional histologic methods have proven of limited use in identifying reactive axonal change early ({$<$}12 h) in the posttraumatic course. Recently, we have reported, in both humans and animals, that antibodies targeting neurofilament subunits are useful in the light microscopic recognition of early reactive change. In the present study, we extend our previous efforts in humans by analyzing the progression of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced axonal change at the ultrastructural level. This effort was initiated to follow the subcellular progression of reactive axonal change in humans and to determine whether this progression parallels that described in animals. Two commercially prepared antibodies were used to recognize reactive axonal change in patients surviving from 6 to 88 h. The NR4 antibody was used to target the light neurofilament subunit (NF-L), and the SMI32 antibody was used to target the heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H). Plastic-embedded tissue sections were screened for evidence of reactive axonal change, and once identified, this reactive change was analyzed at the ultrastructural level. At 6 h survival, focally enlarged, immunoreactive axons with axolemmal infolding or disordered neurofilaments were seen within fields of axons exhibiting no apparent abnormality. By 12 h, some axons exhibited continued neurofilamentous misalignment, pronounced immunoreactivity, vacuolization, and, occasionally, disconnection. At later stages, specifically 30 and 60 h survival, further accumulation of neurofilaments and organelles had led to the further expansion of the axis cylinder, and clearly disconnected reactive swellings were recognized. These contained a dense core of disordered immunoreactive neurofilaments partially encompassed by a cap of less densely aggregated organelles. At 88 h, the reactive axons were larger and elongated, consistent with the continued delivery of organelles by axoplasmic transport. At the later time points, considerable heterogeneity was observed, with focally enlarged disconnected axons being observed in relation to axons showing less advanced reactive change. Our findings suggest that neurofilamentous disruption is a pivotal event in axonal injury.}

  abstract = {Sport concussion is associated with disturbances in brain function in the absence of gross anatomical lesions, and may have long-term health consequences. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods provide a powerful tool for investigating alterations in white matter microstructure reflecting the long-term effects of concussion. In a previous study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed that athletes with a history of concussion had elevated fractional anisotropy (FA) and reduced mean diffusivity (MD) parameters. To better understand these effects, this study compared DTI results to neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), which was used to estimate the intracellular volume fraction (VIC) and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Sixty-eight (68) varsity athletes were recruited, including 37 without a history of concussion and 31 with concussion {$>$}6 months prior to imaging. Univariate analyses showed elevated FA and decreased MD for concussed athletes, along with increased VIC and reduced ODI, indicating greater neurite density and coherence of neurite orientation within white matter. Multivariate analyses also showed that for athletes with a history of concussion, white matter regions with increased FA had increased VIC and decreased ODI, with greater effects among athletes who were imaged a longer time since their last concussion. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between the biophysics of water diffusion and concussion neurobiology for young, healthy adults.

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury is a global health crisis, causing significant death and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation that follows traumatic brain injury has serious consequences for neuronal survival and cognitive impairments, with astrocytes involved in this response. Following traumatic brain injury, astrocytes rapidly become reactive, and astrogliosis propagates from the injury core to distant brain regions. Homeostatic astroglial proteins are downregulated near the traumatic brain injury core, while pro-inflammatory astroglial genes are overexpressed. This altered gene expression is considered a pathological remodeling of astrocytes that produces serious consequences for neuronal survival and cognitive recovery. In addition, glial scar formed by reactive astrocytes is initially necessary to limit immune cell infiltration, but in the long term impedes axonal reconnection and functional recovery. Current therapeutic strategies for traumatic brain injury are focused on preventing acute complications. Statins, cannabinoids, progesterone, beta-blockers, and cerebrolysin demonstrate neuroprotective benefits but most of them have not been studied in the context of astrocytes. In this review, we discuss the cell signaling pathways activated in reactive astrocytes following traumatic brain injury and we discuss some of the potential new strategies aimed to modulate astroglial responses in traumatic brain injury, especially using cell-targeted strategies with miRNAs or lncRNA, viral vectors, and repurposed drugs.},

Objective:~           To describe the trends of SRR-TBIs treated in US emergency departments (EDs) from 2001 to 2012 and to identify which sports and recreational activities and demographic groups are at higher risk for these injuries.           Design:~           Data on initial ED visits for an SRR-TBI from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for 2001-2012 were analyzed.           Setting:~           NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a nationally representative sample of hospital-based EDs.           Participants:~           Cases of TBI were identified from approximately 500 000 annual initial visits for all causes and types of injuries treated in EDs captured by NEISS-AIP.           Main Outcome Measure(s):~           Numbers and rates by age group, sex, and year were estimated. Aggregated numbers and percentages by discharge disposition were produced.           Results:~           Approximately 3.42 million ED visits for an SRR-TBI occurred during 2001-2012. During this period, the rates of SRR-TBIs treated in US EDs significantly increased in both males and females regardless of age (all Ps {$<$} .001). For males, significant increases ranged from a low of 45.8\% (ages 5-9) to a high of 139.8 \% (ages 10-14), and for females, from 25.1\% (ages 0-4) to 211.5\% (ages 15-19) (all Ps {$<$} .001). Every year males had about twice the rates of SRR-TBIs than females. Approximately 70\% of all SRR-TBIs were reported among persons aged 0 to 19 years. The largest number of SRR-TBIs among males occurred during bicycling, football, and basketball. Among females, the largest number of SRR-TBIs occurred during bicycling, playground activities, and horseback riding. Approximately 89\% of males and 91\% of females with an SRR-TBI were treated and released from EDs.           Conclusion and Relevance:~           The rates of ED-treated SRR-TBIs increased during 2001-2012, affecting mainly persons aged 0 to 19 years and males in all age groups. Increases began to appear in 2004 for females and 2006 for males. Activities associated with the largest number of TBIs varied by sex and age. Reasons for the reported increases in ED visits are unknown but may be associated with increased awareness of TBI through increased media exposure and from campaigns, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Heads Up. Prevention efforts should be targeted by sports and recreational activity, age, and sex.},

Measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity ({$\lambda$}1), transverse diffusivity ({$\lambda\perp$}), and volume of voxels containing fibers (VV) were obtained within each tract. To assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, two raters carried out fiber tracking five times on each scan. Scan--rescan and longitudinal reliability were assessed in a subset of four subjects who had six scans, with two sets of three scans separated by 1~year. The statistical reliability of repeated measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV). Spatial agreement of tract shape was assessed using the kappa ({$\kappa$}) statistic. Results: Repeated same-scan fiber tracking evaluations showed good geometric alignment (intra-rater {$\kappa$} {$>$}0.90, inter-rater {$\kappa$} {$>$}0.76) and reliable diffusion property measurements (intra-rater ICC {$>$}0.92, inter-rater ICC {$>$}0.77). FA, MD, and {$\lambda\perp$} were highly reliable with repeated scans on different days, up to a year apart (ICC {$>$}0.8). VV also exhibited good reliability, but with higher CVs. We were unable to demonstrate reproducibility of {$\lambda$}1. Longitudinal reliability after one year was improved by averaging measurements from multiple scans at each time point. Fiber tracking provides a reliable tool for the longitudinal evaluation of white matter diffusion properties.},

The most commonly used tools for evaluating individuals with concussion are the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Standard Concussion Assessment Tool~(SCAT3), and the most recognized computerized neurocognitive test, the~Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). The strengths and limitations of each of these tools, and the Concussion Resolution Index (CRI), CogSport, and King-Devick tests~were evaluated. Based on the data, it appears that the most sensitive and specific of these is the ImPACT test. Additionally, the King-Devick test is an effective adjunct due to its ability to test eye movements and brainstem function.},

  abstract = {Axons span extreme distances and are subject to significant stretch deformations during limb movements or sudden head movements, especially during impacts. Yet, axon biomechanics, and its relation to the ultrastructure that allows axons to withstand mechanical stress, is poorly understood. Using a custom developed force apparatus, we demonstrate that chick dorsal root ganglion axons exhibit a tension buffering or strain-softening response, where its steady state elastic modulus decreases with increasing strain. We then explore the contributions from the various cytoskeletal components of the axon to show that the recently discovered membrane-associated actin-spectrin scaffold plays a prominent mechanical role. Finally, using a theoretical model, we argue that the actin-spectrin skeleton acts as an axonal tension buffer by reversibly unfolding repeat domains of the spectrin tetramers to release excess mechanical stress. Our results revise the current viewpoint that microtubules and their associated proteins are the only significant load-bearing elements in axons.},

They included 11 subjects with CT-evidence of diffuse axonal injury, but no CT-signs of focal contusions. Eleven patients with focal frontal contusions but no CT signs of DAI were matched to and compared with the DAI subjects. Seventeen TBI patients with normal CT scans served as controls.Results: When assessed within the first 4 weeks after TBI, both DAI and frontal contusion patients exhibited behavioural abnormalities and deficits in Wechsler Similarities. The DAI patients were also impaired in Digit Span backward and Stroop interference. When re-assessed, the DAI patients showed considerable deficits in the California Verbal Learning Test and in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.Conclusions: DAI leads to neuropsychological impairment dominated by executive and memory dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Although there are several techniques to analyze diffusion-weighted imaging, any technique must be sufficiently sensitive to detect clinical abnormalities. This is especially critical in disorders like mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), where pathology is likely to be subtle. mTBI represents a major public health concern, especially for youth under 15 years of age. However, the developmental period from birth to 18 years is also a time of tremendous brain changes. Therefore, it is important to establish the degree of age- and sex-related differences. Participants were children aged 8--15 years with mTBI or mild orthopedic injuries. Imaging was obtained within 10 days of injury. We performed tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), deterministic tractography using Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), and probabilistic tractography using TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) to evaluate whether any method provided improved sensitivity at identifying group, developmental, and/or sex-related differences. Although there were no group differences from any of the three analyses, many of the tracts, but not all, revealed increases of fractional anisotropy and decreases of axial, radial, and mean diffusivity with age. TBSS analyses resulted in age-related changes across all white matter tracts. AFQ and TRACULA revealed age-related changes within the corpus callosum, cingulum cingulate, corticospinal tract, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. The results are in many ways consistent across all three methods. However, results from the tractography methods provided improved sensitivity and better tract-specific results for identifying developmental and sex-related differences within the brain.},

Pathological study by brain biopsy is required to confirm DAI; however, performing a brain biopsy for the diagnosis of DAI in a living patient is impossible. Therefore, the diagnosis of DAI in a living patient is clinically determined based on the duration of LOC, clinical manifestations, and the results of conventional brain MRI. There is a shortage of scientific evidence supporting the use of the 6-hour LOC criterion to distinguish DAI from concussion, and axonal injuries have been detected in many concussion cases with a less than 6-hour LOC. Moreover, due to the low sensitivity of conventional brain MRI, which can only detect DAI lesions in approximately half of DAI patients, diagnostic MRI criteria for DAI are not well established. In contrast, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to have high sensitivity for the detection of DAI lesions. As DTI is a relatively new method, further studies aimed at the establishment of diagnostic criteria for DAI detection using DTI are needed. On the other hand, because DAI distribution is not diffuse but multifocal, and because axonal injury lesions have been detected in concussion patients, steps to standardize the use of terms related to axonal injury in both concussion and DAI are necessary.},

Axons in the white matter appear to be especially vulnerable to injury due to the mechanical loading of the brain during TBI. As such, DAI has been found in all severities of TBI and may represent a key pathologic substrate of mild TBI (concussion). Pathologically, DAI encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities from primary mechanical breaking of the axonal cytoskeleton, to transport interruption, swelling and proteolysis, through secondary physiological changes. Depending on the severity and extent of injury, these changes can manifest acutely as immediate loss of consciousness or confusion and persist as coma and/or cognitive dysfunction. In addition, recent evidence suggests that TBI may induce long-term neurodegenerative processes, such as insidiously progressive axonal pathology. Indeed, axonal degeneration has been found to continue even years after injury in humans, and appears to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease-like pathological changes. Here we review the current understanding of DAI as a uniquely mechanical injury, its histopathological identification, and its acute and chronic pathogenesis following TBI.},

No large-scale study, however, has prospectively assessed this in athletes with sport-related concussion (SRC). The aim of the current study was to characterize and compare the prevalence of acute, trauma-related MRI findings and clinically significant, non-specific MRI findings in athletes with and without SRC. College and high-school athletes were prospectively enrolled and participated in scanning sessions between January 2015 through August 2017. Concussed contact sport athletes (n\,=\,138; 14 female [F]; 19.5\,{\textpm}\,1.6 years) completed up to four scanning sessions after SRC. Non-concussed contact (n\,=\,135; 15\,F; 19.7\,{\textpm}\,1.6) and non-contact athletes (n\,=\,96; 15\,F; 20.0\,{\textpm}\,1.7) completed similar scanning sessions and served as controls. Board-certified neuroradiologists, blinded to SRC status, reviewed T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted and T2-weighted images for acute (i.e., injury-related) or non-acute findings that prompted recommendation for clinical follow-up. Concussed athletes were more likely to have MRI findings relative to contact (30.4\% vs. 15.6\%; odds ratio [OR]\,=\,2.32; p\,=\,0.01) and non-contact control athletes (19.8\%; OR\,=\,2.11; p\,=\,0.04). Female athletes were more likely to have MRI findings than males (43.2\% vs. 19.4\%; OR\,=\,2.62; p\,=\,0.01). One athlete with SRC had an acute, injury-related finding; group differences were largely driven by increased rate of non-specific white matter hyperintensities in concussed athletes. This prospective, large-scale study demonstrates that {$<$}1\% of SRCs are associated with acute injury findings on qualitative structural MRI, providing empirical support for clinical guidelines that do not recommend use of MRI after SRC.}

  abstract = {Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a significant feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) across all injury severities and is driven by the primary mechanical insult and secondary biochemical injury phases. Axons comprise an outer cell membrane, the axolemma which is anchored to the cytoskeletal network with spectrin tetramers and actin rings. Neurofilaments act as space-filling structural polymers that surround the central core of microtubules, which facilitate axonal transport. TBI has differential effects on these cytoskeletal components, with axons in the same white matter tract showing a range of different cytoskeletal and axolemma alterations with different patterns of temporal evolution. These require different antibodies for detection in post-mortem tissue. Here, a comprehensive discussion of the evolution of axonal injury within different cytoskeletal elements is provided, alongside the most appropriate methods of detection and their temporal profiles. Accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) as a result of disruption of axonal transport due to microtubule failure remains the most sensitive marker of axonal injury, both acutely and chronically. However, a subset of injured axons demonstrate different pathology, which cannot be detected via APP immunoreactivity, including degradation of spectrin and alterations in neurofilaments. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the node of Ranvier and the axon initial segment as particularly vulnerable sites to axonal injury, with loss of sodium channels persisting beyond the acute phase post-injury in axons without APP pathology. Given the heterogenous response of axons to TBI, further characterization is required in the chronic phase to understand how axonal injury evolves temporally, which may help inform pharmacological interventions.},

In recent years, there have been concerns about the validity of research that uses diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) to understand human brain white matter connections in vivo, in part based on the reliability of analysis methods used in this field. We defined and assessed three dimensions of reliability in dMRI-based tractometry, an analysis technique that assesses the physical properties of white matter pathways: (1) reproducibility, (2) test-retest reliability, and (3) robustness. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide software that automates tractometry (https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ). In measurements from the Human Connectome Project, as well as clinical-grade measurements, we find that tractometry has high test-retest reliability that is comparable to most standardized clinical assessment tools. We find that tractometry is also robust: showing high reliability with different choices of analysis algorithms. Taken together, our results suggest that tractometry is a reliable approach to analysis of white matter connections. The overall approach taken here both demonstrates the specific trustworthiness of tractometry analysis and outlines what researchers can do to establish the reliability of computational analysis pipelines in neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {Background Multi-compartment diffusion models such as Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) have been increasingly used for diffusion MRI (dMRI) data processing in biomedical research. However, those models usually require multiple HARDI shells that may increase scanning duration substantially, and their application can be hindered in uncooperative patients (like infants) accordingly. Also, it is highly expected that the same dataset can be explored with multiple diffusion models for retrieving complementary information. Methods Multiple gradient-encoding schemes which consisted of 4--6 shells, moderate b-values (bmax =1,500 or 2,000 s/mm2), and 32--80 gradient directions were explored. The corresponding time of acquisition (TA) for a single scan ranged from 3 to 8 minutes respectively. The dMRI protocols were tested on macaque monkeys using a 3T clinical setting. The data were analysed using both NODDI and diffusion basic spectrum imaging (DBSI) models. Results The maps of orientation dispersion index (ODI) and CSF were consistent across the 4--6 shell sampling schemes. However, the corresponding intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF) maps showed reduced pixel counts [1,100{\textpm}98 (80 directions) vs. 806{\textpm}70 (32 directions), one slice] in white matter when fewer gradient directions or lower b-value was applied. The hindered diffusion and CSF ratio maps were comparable across these sampling schemes. The maps of restricted diffusion ratio varied across the schemes. However, its mean ratios (0.23{\textpm}0.02 vs. 0.22{\textpm}0.01) and pixel counts (1,540{\textpm}70 vs. 1,510{\textpm}38, one slice) between the schemes of 80 and 32 directions with b=2,000 s/mm2 were comparable. Conclusions The present study reports a fast multi-shell dMRI data acquisition and processing strategy which allows for obtaining complementary information about microstructural alteration and inflammation from a single dMRI data set with both NODDI and DBSI models. The proposed approach may be particularly useful for characterizing the neurodegenerative disorders in uncooperative patients like children or acute stroke patients in which brain injury is associated with inflammation.},

  abstract = {\ding{51}Cerebral edema is caused by a variety of pathological conditions that affect the brain. It is associated with two separate pathophysiological processes with distinct molecular and physiological antecedents: those related to cytotoxic (cellular) edema of neurons and astrocytes, and those related to transcapillary flux of Na+ and other ions, water, and serum macromolecules. In this review, the authors focus exclusively on the first of these two processes. Cytotoxic edema results from unchecked or uncompensated influx of cations, mainly Na+, through cation channels. The authors review the different cation channels that have been implicated in the formation of cytotoxic edema of astrocytes and neurons in different pathological states. A better understanding of these molecular mechanisms holds the promise of improved treatments of cerebral edema and of the secondary injury produced by this pathological process.},

Currently there is no standardized way to perform tractography. Objective To visualize Meyer's loop using deterministic (DTG) and probabilistic tractography (PTG) at different probability levels, with the primary aim to explore possible differences between methods, and the secondary aim to explore anatomical accuracy. Methods Twenty-three diffusion tensor imaging exams (11 controls and 7 TLR-patients, pre- and post-surgical) were analyzed using DTG and PTG thresholded at probability levels 0.2\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 5\% and 10\%. The distance from the tip of the temporal lobe to the anterior limit of Meyer's loop (TP--ML) was measured in 46 optic radiations. Differences in TP--ML between the methods were compared. Results of the control group were compared to dissection studies and to a histological atlas. Results For controls and patients together, there were statistically significant differences (p{$<$}0.01) for TP--ML between all methods thresholded at PTG {$\leq$}1\% compared to all methods thresholded at PTG {$\geq$}5\% and DTG. There were no statistically significant differences between PTG 0.2\%, 0.5\% and 1\% or between PTG 5\%, 10\% and DTG. For the control group, PTG {$\leq$}1\% showed a closer match to dissection studies and PTG 1\% showed the best match to histological tracings of Meyer's loop. Conclusions Choice of tractography method affected the visualized location of Meyer's loop significantly in a heterogeneous, clinically relevant study group. For the controls, PTG at probability levels {$\leq$}1\% was a closer match to dissection studies. To determine the anterior extent of Meyer's loop, PTG is superior to DTG and the probability level of PTG matters.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is able to detect tissue alterations following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that may not be observed on conventional neuroimaging; however, findings are often inconsistent between studies. This systematic review assesses patterns of differences in DWI metrics between those with and without a history of mTBI. A PubMed literature search was performed using relevant indexing terms for articles published prior to May 14, 2020. Findings were limited to human studies using DWI in mTBI. Articles were excluded if they were not full-length, did not contain original data, if they were case studies, pertained to military populations, had inadequate injury severity classification, or did not report post-injury interval. Findings were reported independently for four subgroups: acute/subacute pediatric mTBI, acute/subacute adult mTBI, chronic adult mTBI, and sport-related concussion, and all DWI acquisition and analysis methods used were included. Patterns of findings between studies were reported, along with strengths and weaknesses of the current state of the literature. Although heterogeneity of sample characteristics and study methods limited the consistency of findings, alterations in DWI metrics were most commonly reported in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, internal capsule, and long association pathways. Many acute/subacute pediatric studies reported higher FA and lower ADC or MD in various regions. In contrast, acute/subacute adult studies most commonly indicate lower FA within the context of higher MD and RD. In the chronic phase of recovery, FA may remain low, possibly indicating overall demyelination or Wallerian degeneration over time. Longitudinal studies, though limited, generally indicate at least a partial normalization of DWI metrics over time, which is often associated with functional improvement. We conclude that DWI is able to detect structural mTBI-related abnormalities that may persist over time, although future DWI research will benefit from larger samples, improved data analysis methods, standardized reporting, and increasing transparency.},

While the direct mechanisms by which transection, mechanical strain, ischemia, or complement activation trigger intra-axonal calpain activity are likely different, the downstream effects of unregulated calpain activity may be similar in seemingly disparate diseases. In this review, a brief examination of axonal structure is followed by a focused overview of the calpain family. Finally, the mechanisms by which calpains may disrupt the axonal cytoskeleton, transport, and specialized domains (axon initial segment, nodes, and terminals) are discussed.},

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in detecting TAI, but direct comparison to histologically-confirmed axonal injury has not been performed. In the current study, mice were imaged with DTI, subjected to a moderate cortical controlled impact injury, and re-imaged 4-6 h and 24 h post-injury. Axonal injury was detected by amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and neurofilament immunohistochemistry in pericontusional white matter tracts. The severity of axonal injury was quantified using stereological methods from APP stained histological sections. Two DTI parameters--axial diffusivity and relative anisotropy--were significantly reduced in the injured, pericontusional corpus callosum and external capsule, while no significant changes were seen with conventional MRI in these regions. The contusion was easily detectable on all MRI sequences. Significant correlations were found between changes in relative anisotropy and the density of APP stained axons across mice and across subregions spanning the spatial gradient of injury. The predictive value of DTI was tested using a region with DTI changes (hippocampal commissure) and a region without DTI changes (anterior commissure). Consistent with DTI predictions, there was histological detection of axonal injury in the hippocampal commissure and none in the anterior commissure. These results demonstrate that DTI is able to detect axonal injury, and support the hypothesis that DTI may be more sensitive than conventional imaging methods for this purpose.},

We quantitatively compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) signal abnormalities with histological and electron microscopic characteristics of pericontusional TAI in a mouse model. Two DTI parameters, relative anisotropy and axial diffusivity, were significantly reduced 6 h to 4 d after trauma, corresponding to relatively isolated axonal injury. One to 4 weeks after trauma, relative anisotropy remained decreased, whereas axial diffusivity ``pseudo-normalized'' and radial diffusivity increased. These changes corresponded to demyelination, edema, and persistent axonal injury. At every time point, DTI was more sensitive to injury than conventional magnetic resonance imaging, and relative anisotropy distinguished injured from control mice with no overlap between groups. Remarkably, DTI changes strongly predicted the approximate time since trauma. These results provide an important validation of DTI for pericontusional TAI and suggest novel clinical and forensic applications.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Only a handful of studies have investigated the nature, functional significance, and course of white matter abnormalities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during the semi-acute stage of injury. The present study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and compared the accuracy of traditional anatomic scans, neuropsychological testing, and DTI for objectively classifying mTBI patients from controls. Methods: Twenty-two patients with semi-acute mTBI (mean = 12 days postinjury), 21 matched healthy controls, and a larger sample (n = 32) of healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. A subset of participants was examined longitudinally 3--5 months after their initial visit. Results: mTBI patients did not differ from controls on clinical imaging scans or neuropsychological performance, although effect sizes were consistent with literature values. In contrast, mTBI patients demonstrated significantly greater fractional anisotropy as a result of reduced radial diffusivity in the corpus callosum and several left hemisphere tracts. DTI measures were more accurate than traditional clinical measures in classifying patients from controls. Longitudinal data provided preliminary evidence of partial normalization of DTI values in several white matter tracts. Conclusions: Current findings of white matter abnormalities suggest that cytotoxic edema may be present during the semi-acute phase of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Initial mechanical damage to axons disrupts ionic homeostasis and the ratio of intracellular and extracellular water, primarily affecting diffusion perpendicular to axons. Diffusion tensor imaging measurement may have utility for objectively classifying mTBI, and may serve as a potential biomarker of recovery.}

Particular emphasis is placed on the complex differential diagnoses for patients with prolonged postconcussive symptoms. Methods: Select literature review and synthesis. Results: In spite of an increase in public awareness surrounding the acute and potential long-term effects of mTBI, the medical field remains fragmented both in terms of the diagnostic (different criteria proffered by multiple medical organizations) and prognostic factors that influence patient care. Conclusions: Given the lack of objective biomarkers and the spectrum of different disorders that likely encompass mTBI, clinicians are encouraged to adopt a probabilistic, rather than definitive, diagnostic and prognostic framework. The relevance of accurately diagnosing and managing the different manifestations of mTBI becomes clear when one considers the overall incidence of the disorder (42 million people each year worldwide), and the different treatment implications for patients with a true neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., chronic traumatic encephalopathy; rare) vs potentially treatable conditions (e.g., depression or posttraumatic headache; frequent).}

Objectives: To review the probable physical, physiologic mechanisms that result in the medical and neuropsychologic complications of diffuse axonal injury (DAI)--associated traumatic brain injury (TBI). Data Sources: Various materials were accessed: MEDLINE, textbooks, scientific presentations, and current ongoing research that has been recently reported. Study Selection: Included were scientific studies involving TBI, particularly direct injury to the axons and glia of the central nervous system (CNS) in both in vitro and in vivo models. These studies include pathologic findings in humans as well as the medical complications and behavioral outcomes of DAI. Studies that addressed animal models of DAI as well as cellular and/or tissue models of neuronal injury were emphasized. The review also covered work on the physical properties of materials involved in the transmission of energy associated with prolonged acceleration-deceleration injuries. Data Extraction:Studies were selected with regard to those that addressed the mechanism of TBI associated with DAI and direct injury to the axon within the CNS. The material was generally the emphasis of the article and was extracted by multiple observers. Studies that correlate the above findings with the clinical picture of DAI were included. Data Synthesis: Concepts were developed by the authors based on the current scientific findings and theories of DAI. The synthesis of these concepts involves expertise in physical science, basic science concepts of cellular injury to the CNS, acute medical indicators of DAI, neuropsychologic indicators of DAI, and rehabilitation outcomes from TBI. Conclusions: The term DAI is a misnomer. It is not a diffuse injury to the whole brain, rather it is predominant in discrete regions of the brain following high-speed, long-duration deceleration injuries. DAI is a consistent feature of TBI from transportation-related injuries as well as some sports injuries. The pathology of DAI in humans is characterized histologically by widespread damage to the axons of the brainstem, parasagittal white matter of the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, and the gray-white matter junctions of the cerebral cortex. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans taken initially after injury are often normal. The deformation of the brain due to plastic flow of the neural structures associated with DAI explains the micropathologic findings, radiologic findings, and medical and neuropsychologic complications from this type of injury mechanism. There is evidence that the types of cellular injury in TBI (DAI, anoxic, contusion, hemorrhagic, perfusion-reperfusion) should be differentiated, as all may involve different receptors and biochemical pathways that impact recovery. These differing mechanisms of cellular injury involving specific biochemical pathways and locations of injury may, in part, explain the lack of success in drug trials to ameliorate TBI. {\copyright} 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation},

TBI is the main factor of death and morbidity in young males with a high incidence worldwide. TBI causes central nervous system (CNS) damage under a variety of mechanisms, including synaptic dysfunction, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Glial cells comprise most cells in CNS, which are mediators in the brain's response to TBI. In the CNS are present astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and polydendrocytes (NG2 cells). Astrocytes play critical roles in brain's ion and water homeostasis, energy metabolism, blood-brain barrier, and immune response. In response to TBI, astrocytes change their morphology and protein expression. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the CNS with phagocytic activity. After TBI, microglia also change their morphology and release both pro and anti-inflammatory mediators. Oligodendrocytes are the myelin producers of the CNS, promoting axonal support. TBI causes oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and axonal transport disruption. There are also various interactions between these glial cells and neurons in response to TBI that contribute to the pathophysiology of TBI. In this review, we summarize several glial hallmarks relevant for understanding the brain injury and neuronal damage under TBI conditions.},

To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73 periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis control participants, we tested for group tract differences and show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these tract differences to investigate their association with performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool for diffusion-weighted analyses.},

  abstract = {In biomedical research, the outcome of longitudinal studies has been traditionally analyzed using the repeated measures analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) or more recently, linear mixed models (LMEMs). Although LMEMs are less restrictive than rm-ANOVA as they can work with unbalanced data and non-constant correlation between observations, both methodologies assume a linear trend in the measured response. It is common in biomedical research that the true trend response is nonlinear and in these cases the linearity assumption of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs can lead to biased estimates and unreliable inference. In contrast, GAMs relax the linearity assumption of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs and allow the data to determine the fit of the model while also permitting incomplete observations and different correlation structures. Therefore, GAMs present an excellent choice to analyze longitudinal data with non-linear trends in the context of biomedical research. This paper summarizes the limitations of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs and uses simulated data to visually show how both methods produce biased estimates when used on data with non-linear trends. We present the basic theory of GAMs and using reported trends of oxygen saturation in tumors, we simulate example longitudinal data (2 treatment groups, 10 subjects per group, 5 repeated measures for each group) to demonstrate their implementation in R. We also show that GAMs are able to produce estimates with non-linear trends even when incomplete observations exist (with 40\% of the simulated observations missing).

Application of a generalized additive model (GAM) to reveal relationships between environmental factors and distributions of pelagic fish and krill: a case study in Sendai Bay, Japan. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1417--1424.A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to fishery-survey data to reveal the influences of environmental factors on the distribution patterns of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and krill (Euphausia pacifica). Echosounder and physical-oceanographic data were collected in Sendai Bay, Japan, in spring 2005. A hierarchical model was used with two spatial strata: (i) presence and absence of each species; and (ii) biomass density of each species, given its presence; and six environmental covariates (surface water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll, and near-seabed water temperature, salinity, and depth). The results indicate non-linear responses of the two indices to the environmental covariates. In addition, the biomasses estimated by the GAMs were comparable with estimates based on conventional, stratified-random sampling for each species. GAMs are very useful for (i) investigating the effects of environmental factors on the distributions of biological organisms, and (ii) predicting the distributions of animal densities in unsurveyed areas.}

  abstract = {We review, systematize and discuss models of diffusion in neuronal tissue, by putting them into an overarching physical context of coarse-graining over an increasing diffusion length scale. From this perspective, we view research on quantifying brain microstructure as occurring along three major avenues. The first avenue focusses on transient, or time-dependent, effects in diffusion. These effects signify the gradual coarse-graining of tissue structure, which occurs qualitatively differently in different brain tissue compartments. We show that transient effects contain information about the relevant length scales for neuronal tissue, such as the packing correlation length for neuronal fibers, as well as the degree of structural disorder along the neurites. The second avenue corresponds to the long-time limit, when the observed signal can be approximated as a sum of multiple nonexchanging anisotropic Gaussian components. Here, the challenge lies in parameter estimation and in resolving its hidden degeneracies. The third avenue employs multiple diffusion encoding techniques, able to access information not contained in the conventional diffusion propagator. We conclude with our outlook on future directions that could open exciting possibilities for designing quantitative markers of tissue physiology and pathology, based on methods of studying mesoscopic transport in disordered systems.},

The radioiodinated neurofilament proteins (untreated and dephosphorylated) were incubated in the presence and absence of calpain from rabbit skeletal muscle, and the degradation rates of large (NF-H), mid-sized (NF-M) and small (NF-L) neurofilament polypeptides were analysed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The degradation of dephosphorylated neurofilament proteins occurred at a higher rate, and to a greater extent, than did that of the phosphorylated (untreated) neurofilament proteins. The dephosphorylated high-molecular-mass neurofilament (NF-HD) was proteolyzed 6 times more quickly than the untreated NF-H. The degradation rate of the NF-M and NF-L neurofilament proteins was also enhanced after dephosphorylation, but less than that of NF-H. This indicates that the dephosphorylation of neurofilament proteins can increase their sensitivity to calpain degradation.}

This consensus process also integrated new features including a focus on the para athlete, the athlete's perspective, concussion-specific medical ethics and matters related to both athlete retirement and the potential long-term effects of SRC, including neurodegenerative disease.

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R.

  abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated [Pettus et al.,J. Neurotrauma, 11 (1994) 507--522] that moderate traumatic brain injury evokes alterations in axolemmal permeability associated with rapid local compaction of axonal neurofilaments (NF). The current communication fully characterizes these local NF changes, while also exploring the possibility of other related cytoskeletal abnormalities. A tracer normally excluded by the intact axolemma (horseradish peroxidase) was administered intrathecally in cats, which were then subjected to moderate/severe fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). After survival times ranging from 5 min to 6 h post-traumatic brain injury (T131), the animals were perfused and processed for light microscopic (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) visualization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). HRP-containing axons identified by LM, were investigated by EM in both the sagittal and coronal planes. Electron micrographs were videographically captured, digitized, and analyzed for cytoskeletal distribution. Local alterations in axolemmal permeability to HRP were detected, and consistently linked with distinct cytoskeletal changes. Within 5 min of injury, the injured HRP-containing axons displayed a significant decrease in inter-NF spacing associated with a lack of NF side arm projections. Density analysis proved a significant increase in NF packing in the HRP-containing axons, and further revealed an associated significant decrease in microtubule (MT) density. All ultrastructural changes were seen within 5 min of injury, and persisted unchanged for up to 6 h post-TBI. Collectively, these abnormalities suggest that altered axolemmal permeability triggers a rapid, yet persisting general cytoskeletal change most likely linked to local ionic disregulation. We posit that this local cytoskeletal collapse/alteration marks a site of impaired axonal transport, associated with upstream axoplasmic swelling and eventual axonal detachment.},

  abstract = {Recently we reported that traumatic brain injury evokes local changes in the axolemma's permeability, in concert with local cytoskeletal changes involving neurofilament (NF) compaction and sidearm loss, all of which contribute to the genesis of reactive axonal change. Since it was of concern that these events may be either injury model- or species-specific, we sought to address these phenomena in a different but well-characterized animal model and species. Further, to provide more compelling insight into the potential for NF compaction and sidearm alteration, we also employed antibodies specific for the NF rod domains, which are readily visualized only when the NF sidearms are disturbed. Rats were subjected to impact acceleration injury. To assess the potential for altered axolemmal permeability, 5 animals received intrathecal horseradish peroxidase (HRP), normally excluded by the intact axolemma. To assess the potential for NF sidearm alteration, another 14 animals were processed for the visualization of antibodies targeting the NF rod domain at 5 minutes (min) to 24 hours (h) postinjury. All animals were evaluated at the LM and EM levels. Those animals receiving intrathecal HRP showed immediate focal alterations in the axolemma's permeability to the normally excluded tracer. Over a 2 h period, these axons demonstrated NF compaction. Antibodies targeted to the rod domains revealed focal intra-axonal immunoreactivity in sites closely correlated with those showing altered axolemmal permeability. These same sites also demonstrated evidence of NF compaction and sidearm loss/perturbation. Collectively, these findings suggest that occurrence of altered axolemmal permeability and concomitant cytoskeletal change are features common to traumatic brain injury in various animal models and species. Further, these studies underscore the utility of antibodies targeting the rod domain for the early detection of traumatically induced reactive change.}

Here, we present a method for deriving tract-specific diffusion statistics, based upon predefined regions of interest. Our approach derives a population distribution using probabilistic tractography, based on the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Enhanced Rockland sample. We determine the most likely geometry of a path between two regions and express this as a spatial distribution. We then estimate the average orientation of streamlines traversing this path, at discrete distances along its trajectory, and the fraction of diffusion directed along this orientation for each participant. The resulting participant-wise metrics (tract-specific anisotropy; TSA) can then be used for statistical analysis on any comparable population. Based on this method, we report both negative and positive associations between age and TSA for two networks derived from published meta-analytic studies (the ``default mode'' and ``what-where'' networks), along with more moderate sex differences and age-by-sex interactions. The proposed method can be applied to any arbitrary set of brain regions, to estimate both the spatial trajectory and DWI-based anisotropy specific to those regions.},

  abstract = {The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the corticospinal tract as important for this classification, correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.},

CytE contributes to brain swelling with a resultant increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). However, questions remain concerning the magnitude of the contribution made by CytE to raised ICP and the ability of CytE by itself to produce lethal levels of ICP that result in brainstem herniation. These questions exist because there are pitfalls in estimating the magnitude of CytE and hence its contribution to ICP using either electron microscopy or in vivo surrogates for CytE such as impedance measurements or the apparent diffusion coefficient. Correlation of these measures has been made during CytE. However, the literature provides reasons to question whether any of these surrogates for CytE can give accurate quantitative measures of CytE. At present, there is little evidence to indicate that CytE can, by itself, raise ICP to lethal levels. However, because CytE can raise ICP, it is of interest to develop treatments to prevent or reduce CytE even though currently available data do not yet provide an established mechanistic basis upon which to base such therapy.}

Some studies have suggested that white matter properties serve as static predictors of academic skills, whereas other studies have observed no such relationship. On the other hand, longitudinal studies have suggested that within-individual changes in the white matter are linked to learning gains over time. In the present study, we look to replicate and extend the previous longitudinal results linking longitudinal changes in the white matter properties of the left arcuate fasciculus to individual differences in reading development. To do so, we analyzed diffusion MRI data, along with reading and mathematics scores in a longitudinal sample of 340 students as they progressed from 1st grade into 4th grade. Longitudinal growth models revealed that year-to-year within-individual changes in reading scores, but not math, were related to the development of the left arcuate fasciculus. These findings provide further evidence linking the dynamics of white matter development and learning in a unique sample and highlight the importance of longitudinal designs.}

Using fluorescence lifetime imaging to analyze contributions of intracellular ionic changes in brain slices, we find that intense Na+ entry triggers a secondary increase in intracellular Cl- that is required for neuronal swelling and death. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated knockdown screening identified the ion exchanger SLC26A11 unexpectedly acting as a voltage-gated Cl- channel that is activated upon neuronal depolarization to membrane potentials lower than -20~mV. Blockade of SLC26A11 activity attenuates both neuronal swelling and cell death. Therefore cytotoxic neuronal edema occurs when sufficient Na+ influx and depolarization is followed by Cl- entry via SLC26A11. The resultant NaCl accumulation causes subsequent~neuronal swelling leading to neuronal death. These findings shed light on unique elements of volume control in excitable cells and lay the ground for the development of specific treatments for brain edema.}

Scaling up tractography to meet these high-throughput demands yields new fiber tracking challenges, such as minimizing spurious connections and controlling for gyral biases. The aim of this study is to determine which of the two broadest classes of tractography algorithms---deterministic or probabilistic---is most suited to mapping connectomes. Methods This study develops numerical connectome phantoms that feature realistic network topologies and that are matched to the fiber complexity of in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. The phantoms are utilized to evaluate the performance of tensor-based and multi-fiber implementations of deterministic and probabilistic tractography. Results For connectome phantoms that are representative of the fiber complexity of in vivo dMRI, multi-fiber deterministic tractography yields the most accurate connectome reconstructions (F-measure = 0.35). Probabilistic algorithms are hampered by an abundance of false-positive connections, leading to lower specificity (F = 0.19). While omitting connections with the fewest number of streamlines (thresholding) improves the performance of probabilistic algorithms (F = 0.38), multi-fiber deterministic tractography remains optimal when it benefits from thresholding (F = 0.42). Conclusions Multi-fiber deterministic tractography is well suited to connectome mapping, while connectome thresholding is essential when using probabilistic algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background: The utility of postconcussion neurocognitive testing versus symptom data has been debated. The sensitivity of the desktop version of the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) tool has been documented, but psychometric properties of the recently released online version of ImPACT have yet to be fully established. Purpose: To document the sensitivity of the online ImPACT version in samples of (1) symptomatic concussed (high school and collegiate) athletes, and (2) asymptomatic concussed (high school and collegiate) athletes suspected of hiding their concussions. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 81 athletes observed to sustain a concussion by a certified athletic trainer or team physician, a finding that was confirmed with reported postconcussion symptoms, completed the ImPACT test within 3 days of injury. Data were compared with an independent sample of 81 athletes who completed preseason baseline cognitive assessments using ImPACT and who were matched (with concussed athletes) on the basis of sex, age, sport, concussion history, and absence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disability. An independent group of 37 athletes who were also observed to sustain a concussion completed ImPACT within 3 days of injury. These athletes reported no postconcussion symptoms but were noted for suspected invalid response patterns on ImPACT (Impulse Control index {$>$}30 and Verbal Memory index {$<$}69\%). The subscale data from the assessments (excluding those contributing to the aforementioned indices) were compared with a matched sample of 37 athletes who completed preseason baseline cognitive assessments in ImPACT (using the same criteria described above). Results: Data from the ImPACT online version yielded 91.4\% sensitivity and 69.1\% specificity. For asymptomatic athletes suspected of hiding their concussion, data from ImPACT yielded 94.6\% sensitivity and 97.3\% specificity. Conclusion: The online version of the ImPACT tool is a valid measure of neurocognitive performance at the acute stages of concussion, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity, even when athletes appear to be denying postconcussion symptoms.},

  abstract = {This contribution presents an approach to model individual tree height--diameter relationships for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in multi-size and mixed-species stands in Estonia using the Estonian Permanent Forest Research Plot Network. The dataset includes 22,347 trees. The main focus of the study was to use an approach that is spatially explicit allowing for high accuracy prediction from a minimum set of predictor variables that can be easily derived. Consequently, the height--diameter relationship is modeled as a function of only the stand quadratic mean diameter (dg) and the plot geographical coordinates. A specific generalized additive model gam is employed that allows for the integration of a varying coefficient term and 2-dimensional surface estimators representing a spatial trend and a spatially varying coefficient term. The high flexibility of the model is needed due to the very few predictor variables that subsume a variety of potential influential factors. Subsequently, a linear mixed model is used that quantifies the random variation between plots and between measurement occasions within plots, respectively. Hence, our model is based on the theory of structured additive regression models (Fahrmeir et al. 2007) and separates a structured (correlated) spatial effect from an unstructured (uncorrelated) spatial effect. Additionally, the linear mixed model allows for calibration of the model using height measurements as pre-information. Model bias is small, despite the somewhat irregular distribution of experimental areas within the country. The overall model shows some similarity with earlier applications in Finland. However, there are important differences involving the model form, the predictors and the method of parameter estimation.},

Design Rapid evidence reviews on 12 clinical questions and Delphi method for expert consensus. Participants The Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Brain Injury Special Interest Group convened a Working Group of 17 members and an external interdisciplinary expert panel of 32 clinician-scientists. Public stakeholder feedback was analyzed from 68 individuals and 23 organizations. Results The first 2 Delphi votes asked the expert panel to rate their agreement with both the diagnostic criteria for mild TBI and the supporting evidence statements. In the first round, 10 of 12 evidence statements reached consensus agreement. Revised evidence statements underwent a second round of expert panel voting, where consensus was achieved for all. For the diagnostic criteria, the final agreement rate, after the third vote, was 90.7\%. Public stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the diagnostic criteria revision prior to the third expert panel vote. A terminology question was added to the third round of Delphi voting, where 30 of 32 (93.8\%) expert panel members agreed that `the diagnostic label `concussion' may be used interchangeably with `mild TBI' when neuroimaging is normal or not clinically indicated.' Conclusions New diagnostic criteria for mild TBI were developed through an evidence review and expert consensus process. Having unified diagnostic criteria for mild TBI can improve the quality and consistency of mild TBI research and clinical care.},

  abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g., span width, degree of polynomial). Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter {$\delta$}15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3,000-year alkenone record from Braya-S{\o}, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.}

  abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

  abstract = {Despite being a major health concern, little is known about the pathophysiological changes that underly concussion. Nonetheless, emerging evidence suggests that selective damage to white matter axons, or diffuse axonal injury (DAI), disrupts brain network connectivity and function. While voltage-gated sodium channels (NaChs) and their anchoring proteins at the nodes of Ranvier (NOR) on axons are key elements of the brain's network signaling machinery, changes in their integrity have not been studied in context with DAI. Here, we utilized a clinically relevant swine model of concussion that induces evolving axonal pathology, demonstrated by accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) across the white matter. Over a~two-week follow-up~post-concussion with this model, we found widespread loss of NaCh isoform 1.6 (Nav1.6), progressive increases in NOR length, the appearance of void and heminodes and loss of {$\beta$}IV-spectrin, ankyrin G, and neurofascin 186 or their collective diffusion into the paranode. Notably, these changes were in close proximity, yet distinct from APP-immunoreactive swollen axonal profiles, potentially representing a unique, newfound phenotype of axonal pathology in DAI. Since concussion in humans is non-fatal, the clinical relevance of these findings was determined through examination of post-mortem brain tissue from humans with higher levels of acute traumatic brain injury. Here, a similar loss of Nav1.6 and changes in NOR structures in brain white matter~were observed as found~in the swine model of concussion. Collectively, this widespread and progressive disruption of NaChs and NOR appears to be a form of sodium channelopathy, which may represent an important substrate underlying brain network dysfunction after concussion.},

  abstract = {Analyzing data from multiple neuroimaging studies has great potential in terms of increasing statistical power, enabling detection of effects of smaller magnitude than would be possible when analyzing each study separately and also allowing to systematically investigate between-study differences. Restrictions due to privacy or proprietary data as well as more practical concerns can make it hard to share neuroimaging datasets, such that analyzing all data in a common location might be impractical or impossible. Meta-analytic methods provide a way to overcome this issue, by combining aggregated quantities like model parameters or risk ratios. Most meta-analytic tools focus on parametric statistical models, and methods for meta-analyzing semi-parametric models like generalized additive models have not been well developed. Parametric models are often not appropriate in neuroimaging, where for instance age-brain relationships may take forms that are difficult to accurately describe using such models. In this paper we introduce meta-GAM, a method for meta-analysis of generalized additive models which does not require individual participant data, and hence is suitable for increasing statistical power while upholding privacy and other regulatory concerns. We extend previous works by enabling the analysis of multiple model terms as well as multivariate smooth functions. In addition, we show how meta-analytic p-values can be computed for smooth terms. The proposed methods are shown to perform well in simulation experiments, and are demonstrated in a real data analysis on hippocampal volume and self-reported sleep quality data from the Lifebrain consortium. We argue that application of meta-GAM is especially beneficial in lifespan neuroscience and imaging genetics. The methods are implemented in an accompanying R package metagam, which is also demonstrated.},

The anatomy and physiology of the head are complex and thus apoptosis has mostly been followed in separate structures, tissues or cell types. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent knowledge concerning apoptosis-related molecules involved in the development of structures of head with a particular focus on caspases, cysteine proteases having a key position in apoptotic pathways. Since many classical apoptosis-related molecules, including caspases, are emerging in several non-apoptotic processes, these were also considered. The largest organ of the head region is the brain and its development has been extensively investigated, including the roles of apoptosis and related molecules. Neurogenesis research also includes sensory organs such as the eye and ear, efferent nervous system and associated muscles and glands. Caspases have been also associated with normal function of the skin and hair follicles. Regarding mineralised tissues within craniofacial morphogenesis, apoptosis in bones has been of interest along with palate fusion and tooth development. Finally, the role of apoptosis and caspases in angiogenesis, necessary for any tissue/organ development and maintenance/homeostasis, are discussed. Additionally, this review points to abnormalities of development resulting from improper expression/activation of apoptosis-related molecules.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.}

  abstract = {This article provides a tutorial for analyzing pupillometric data. Pupil dilation has become increasingly popular in psychological and psycholinguistic research as a measure to trace language processing. However, there is no general consensus about procedures to analyze the data, with most studies analyzing extracted features from the pupil dilation data instead of analyzing the pupil dilation trajectories directly. Recent studies have started to apply nonlinear regression and other methods to analyze the pupil dilation trajectories directly, utilizing all available information in the continuously measured signal. This article applies a nonlinear regression analysis, generalized additive mixed modeling, and illustrates how to analyze the full-time course of the pupil dilation signal. The regression analysis is particularly suited for analyzing pupil dilation in the fields of psychological and psycholinguistic research because generalized additive mixed models can include complex nonlinear interactions for investigating the effects of properties of stimuli (e.g., formant frequency) or participants (e.g., working memory score) on the pupil dilation signal. To account for the variation due to participants and items, nonlinear random effects can be included. However, one of the challenges for analyzing time series data is dealing with the autocorrelation in the residuals, which is rather extreme for the pupillary signal. On the basis of simulations, we explain potential causes of this extreme autocorrelation, and on the basis of the experimental data, we show how to reduce their adverse effects, allowing a much more coherent interpretation of pupillary data than possible with feature-based techniques.},

  abstract = {In designed experiments and in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess the effect of a quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a multienvironment agricultural field experiment in which a yield--seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and non-smooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented.}

  abstract = {Objectives: To identify structural connectivity change occurring during the first 6 months after traumatic brain injury and to evaluate the utility of diffusion tensor tractography for predicting long-term outcome. Methods: The participants were 28 patients with mild to severe traumatic axonal injury and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Neuroimaging was obtained 0--9 days postinjury for acute scans and 6--14 months postinjury for chronic scans. Long-term outcome was evaluated on the day of the chronic scan. Twenty-eight fiber regions of 9 major white matter structures were reconstructed, and reliable tractography measurements were determined and used. Results: Although most (23 of 28) patients had severe brain injury, their long-term outcome ranged from good recovery (16 patients) to moderately (5 patients) and severely disabled (7 patients). In concordance with the diverse outcome, the white matter change in patients was heterogeneous, ranging from improved structural connectivity, through no change, to deteriorated connectivity. At the group level, all 9 fiber tracts deteriorated significantly with 7 (corpus callosum, cingulum, angular bundle, cerebral peduncular fibers, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi) showing structural damage acutely and 2 (fornix body and left arcuate fasciculus) chronically. Importantly, the amount of change in tractography measurements correlated with patients' long-term outcome. Acute tractography measurements were able to predict patients' learning and memory performance; chronic measurements also determined performance on processing speed and executive function. Conclusions: Diffusion tensor tractography is a valuable tool for identifying structural connectivity changes occurring between the acute and chronic stages of traumatic brain injury and for predicting patients' long-term outcome.}

  abstract = {In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

  abstract = {In phonetics, many datasets are encountered which deal with dynamic data collected over time. Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {The onset of adolescence in humans is marked by hormonal changes that give rise to secondary sexual characteristics, noted as puberty. It has, however, proven challenging to unravel to what extent pubertal changes may have organizing effects on the brain beyond chronological age, as reported in animal studies. The present longitudinal study aimed to characterize the unique effects of age and puberty on subcortical brain volumes and included three waves of data collection at two-year intervals and 680 T1-weighted MRI scans of 271 participants (54\% females) aged between 8 and 29 years old. Generalized additive mixed model procedures were used to assess the effects of age, self-report pubertal status and testosterone level on basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum gray matter volumes. We observed age-related increases in putamen and pallidum volumes, and decreases in accumbens and thalamus volumes, all show larger volumes in boys than girls. Only the cerebellum showed an interaction effect of age by sex, such that males showed prolonged increases in cerebellar volume than females. Next, we showed that changes in self-report puberty status better described developmental change than chronological age for most structures in males, and for caudate, pallidum and hippocampal volumes in females. Furthermore, changes in testosterone level were related to development of pallidum, accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala volumes in males and caudate and hippocampal volumes in females. The modeling approach of the present study allowed us to characterize the complex interactions between chronological age and pubertal maturational changes, and the findings indicate puberty unique changes in brain structure that are sex specific.},

  abstract = {The use of the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is rapidly growing in the neuroimaging field. Nevertheless, rigorously performed quantitative validation of DTI pathologic metrics remains very limited owing to the difficulty in co-registering quantitative histology findings with magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this review is to summarize the existing state-of-the-art knowledge with respect to axial ({$\lambda$}|) and radial ({$\lambda$}┴) diffusivity as DTI markers of axonal and myelin damage, respectively. First, we provide technical background for DTI and briefly discuss the specific organization of white matter in bundles of axonal fibers running in parallel; this is the natural target for imaging based on diffusion anisotropy. Second, we discuss the four seminal studies that paved the way for considering axial ({$\lambda$}|) and radial ({$\lambda$}┴) diffusivity as potential in vivo surrogate markers of axonal and myelin damage, respectively. Then, we present difficulties in interpreting axial ({$\lambda$}|) and radial ({$\lambda$}┴) diffusivity in clinical conditions associated with inflammation, edema, and white matter fiber crossing. Finally, future directions are highlighted. In summary, DTI can reveal strategic information with respect to white matter tracts, disconnection mechanisms, and related symptoms. Axial ({$\lambda$}|) and radial ({$\lambda$}┴) diffusivity seem to provide quite consistent information in healthy subjects, and in pathological conditions with limited edema and inflammatory changes. DTI remains one of the most promising non-invasive diagnostic tools in medicine.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is crucial for the diagnosis and prognosis of heart disease. However, normal reference values for CMR-derived morphology parameters have not been established for Chinese children. We sought to establish reference values for ventricular and atrial size and function parameters using CMR in healthy Chinese children across a broad age range. Methods 3-T CMR scans were performed in 191 healthy children, aged 4--18 years. We used balanced steady-state free precession sequence for analyzing chamber size and function. Reference percentile curves and tables were generated using the generalized additive model for location scale and shape. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare our results with those of relevant previously published studies. Results Boys generally had greater ventricular volumes and masses after normalization for body surface area (BSA) compared with girls. However, in the youngest age group (4--8 years), differences in volumes or masses between sexes were not found. Additionally, differences were not observed in left ventricular and right ventricular ejection fractions between sexes upon stratifying subjects based on age groups. However, after normalizing for BSA, only the maximal right atrial volume (RAVmax) remained significantly greater in boys than that in girls. Age-specific and BSA-specific reference curves revealed non-linear relationships between age/BSA and cardiac parameters. Asian children exhibited significantly smaller chamber sizes compared to those seen in Caucasian children. Conclusion We report normative CMR ventricular and atrial volume and function in Chinese children based on BSA, age, and sex, which can serve as a reference for future studies and clinical practice.},

We used an interrupted time-series design and analyzed the concussion data (2005--2016) from High School Reporting Injury Online. We examined the trends of new or recurrent concussion rates among US representative high-school athletes participating in 9 sports across prelaw, immediate-postlaw, and postlaw periods by using general linear models. We defined 1 athlete exposure as attending 1 competition or practice. Results. We included a total of 8043 reported concussions (88.7\% new, 11.3\% recurrent). The average annual concussion rate was 39.8 per 100\,000 athlete exposures. We observed significantly increased trends of reported new and recurrent concussions from the prelaw, through immediate-postlaw, into the postlaw period. However, the recurrent concussion rate showed a significant decline 2.6 years after the laws went into effect. Football exhibited different trends compared with other boys' sports and girls' sports. Conclusions. Observed trends of increased concussion rates are likely attributable to increased identification and reporting. Additional research is needed to evaluate intended long-term impact of traumatic brain injury laws.}

  abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a health threat that affects every year millions of people involved in motor vehicle and sporting accidents, and thousands of soldiers in battlefields. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is one of the most frequent types of TBI leading to death. In DAI, the initial traumatic event is followed by a cascade of biochemical changes that take time to develop in full, so that symptoms may not become apparent until days or weeks after the original injury. Hence, DAI is a dynamic process, and the opportunity exists to prevent its progression provided the initial trauma can be predicted at the molecular level. Here, we present preliminary evidence from micro-finite element (FE) simulations that the mechanical response of central nervous system myelinated fibers is dependent on the axonal diameter, the ratio between axon diameter and fiber diameter (g-ratio), the microtubules density, and the cholesterol concentration in the axolemma and myelin. A key outcome of the simulations is that there is a significant difference between the overall level of strain in a given axonal segment and the level of local strain in the Ranvier nodes contained in that segment, with the nodal strain being much larger than the total strain. We suggest that the acquisition of this geometric and biochemical information by means of already available high resolution magnetic resonance imaging techniques, and its incorporation in current FE models of the brain will enhance the models capacity to predict the site and magnitude of primary axonal damage upon TBI.}
