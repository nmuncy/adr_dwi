  abstract = {Concussions present with a myriad of symptomatic and cognitive concerns; however, the relationship between these functional disruptions and the underlying changes in the brain are not yet well understood. Hubs, or brain regions that are connected to many different functional networks, may be specifically disrupted after concussion. Given the implications in concussion research, we quantified hub disruption within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other brain networks. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from collegiate student-athletes (n\,=\,44) at three time points: baseline (before beginning their athletic season), acute post-injury (approximately 48h after a diagnosed concussion), and recovery (after starting return-to-play progression, but before returning to contact). We used self-reported symptoms and computerized cognitive assessments collected across similar time points to link these functional connectivity changes to clinical outcomes. Concussion resulted in increased connectivity between regions within the DMN compared with baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more positively related to symptoms and more negatively related to visual memory performance compared with baseline and recovery. Further, concussion led to decreased connectivity between DMN hubs and visual network non-hubs relative to baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more negatively related to somatic symptoms and more positively related to visual memory performance compared with baseline and recovery. Relationships between functional connectivity, symptoms, and cognition were not significantly different at baseline versus recovery. These results highlight a unique relationship between self-reported symptoms, visual memory performance, and acute functional connectivity changes involving DMN hubs after concussion in athletes. This may provide evidence for a disrupted balance of within- and between-network communication highlighting possible network inefficiencies after concussion. These results aid in our understanding of the pathophysiological disruptions after concussion and inform our understanding of the associations between disruptions in brain connectivity and specific clinical presentations acutely post-injury.}

Despite its predominance in the EEG signal, large variations can be observed in alpha properties during development, with an increase in alpha frequency over childhood and adulthood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these changes in alpha rhythm are related to the maturation of visual white matter pathways. We capitalized on a large diffusion MRI (dMRI)-EEG dataset (dMRI n = 2,747, EEG n = 2,561) of children and adolescents of either sex (age range, 5--21 years old) and showed that maturation of the optic radiation specifically accounts for developmental changes of alpha frequency. Behavioral analyses also confirmed that variations of alpha frequency are related to maturational changes in visual perception. The present findings demonstrate the close link between developmental variations in white matter tissue properties, electrophysiological responses, and behavior.},

Objective:~           To describe the trends of SRR-TBIs treated in US emergency departments (EDs) from 2001 to 2012 and to identify which sports and recreational activities and demographic groups are at higher risk for these injuries.           Design:~           Data on initial ED visits for an SRR-TBI from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for 2001-2012 were analyzed.           Setting:~           NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a nationally representative sample of hospital-based EDs.           Participants:~           Cases of TBI were identified from approximately 500 000 annual initial visits for all causes and types of injuries treated in EDs captured by NEISS-AIP.           Main Outcome Measure(s):~           Numbers and rates by age group, sex, and year were estimated. Aggregated numbers and percentages by discharge disposition were produced.           Results:~           Approximately 3.42 million ED visits for an SRR-TBI occurred during 2001-2012. During this period, the rates of SRR-TBIs treated in US EDs significantly increased in both males and females regardless of age (all Ps {$<$} .001). For males, significant increases ranged from a low of 45.8\% (ages 5-9) to a high of 139.8 \% (ages 10-14), and for females, from 25.1\% (ages 0-4) to 211.5\% (ages 15-19) (all Ps {$<$} .001). Every year males had about twice the rates of SRR-TBIs than females. Approximately 70\% of all SRR-TBIs were reported among persons aged 0 to 19 years. The largest number of SRR-TBIs among males occurred during bicycling, football, and basketball. Among females, the largest number of SRR-TBIs occurred during bicycling, playground activities, and horseback riding. Approximately 89\% of males and 91\% of females with an SRR-TBI were treated and released from EDs.           Conclusion and Relevance:~           The rates of ED-treated SRR-TBIs increased during 2001-2012, affecting mainly persons aged 0 to 19 years and males in all age groups. Increases began to appear in 2004 for females and 2006 for males. Activities associated with the largest number of TBIs varied by sex and age. Reasons for the reported increases in ED visits are unknown but may be associated with increased awareness of TBI through increased media exposure and from campaigns, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Heads Up. Prevention efforts should be targeted by sports and recreational activity, age, and sex.},

Under-recognition of concussions can lead to premature clearance for athletic participation, leaving athletes vulnerable to repeat injury and subsequent short- and long-term complications. There is overwhelming evidence that assessment and management of sports-related concussions should involve a multifaceted approach. A number of assessment criteria have been developed for this purpose. It is important to understand the available and emerging diagnostic testing modalities for sports-related concussions. The most commonly used tools for evaluating individuals with concussion are the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Standard Concussion Assessment Tool~(SCAT3), and the most recognized computerized neurocognitive test, the~Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). The strengths and limitations of each of these tools, and the Concussion Resolution Index (CRI), CogSport, and King-Devick tests~were evaluated. Based on the data, it appears that the most sensitive and specific of these is the ImPACT test. Additionally, the King-Devick test is an effective adjunct due to its ability to test eye movements and brainstem function.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can cause abnormalities in clinically relevant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. No large-scale study, however, has prospectively assessed this in athletes with sport-related concussion (SRC). The aim of the current study was to characterize and compare the prevalence of acute, trauma-related MRI findings and clinically significant, non-specific MRI findings in athletes with and without SRC. College and high-school athletes were prospectively enrolled and participated in scanning sessions between January 2015 through August 2017. Concussed contact sport athletes (n\,=\,138; 14 female [F]; 19.5\,{\textpm}\,1.6 years) completed up to four scanning sessions after SRC. Non-concussed contact (n\,=\,135; 15\,F; 19.7\,{\textpm}\,1.6) and non-contact athletes (n\,=\,96; 15\,F; 20.0\,{\textpm}\,1.7) completed similar scanning sessions and served as controls. Board-certified neuroradiologists, blinded to SRC status, reviewed T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted and T2-weighted images for acute (i.e., injury-related) or non-acute findings that prompted recommendation for clinical follow-up. Concussed athletes were more likely to have MRI findings relative to contact (30.4\% vs. 15.6\%; odds ratio [OR]\,=\,2.32; p\,=\,0.01) and non-contact control athletes (19.8\%; OR\,=\,2.11; p\,=\,0.04). Female athletes were more likely to have MRI findings than males (43.2\% vs. 19.4\%; OR\,=\,2.62; p\,=\,0.01). One athlete with SRC had an acute, injury-related finding; group differences were largely driven by increased rate of non-specific white matter hyperintensities in concussed athletes. This prospective, large-scale study demonstrates that {$<$}1\% of SRCs are associated with acute injury findings on qualitative structural MRI, providing empirical support for clinical guidelines that do not recommend use of MRI after SRC.}

In recent years, there have been concerns about the validity of research that uses diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) to understand human brain white matter connections in vivo, in part based on the reliability of analysis methods used in this field. We defined and assessed three dimensions of reliability in dMRI-based tractometry, an analysis technique that assesses the physical properties of white matter pathways: (1) reproducibility, (2) test-retest reliability, and (3) robustness. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide software that automates tractometry (https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ). In measurements from the Human Connectome Project, as well as clinical-grade measurements, we find that tractometry has high test-retest reliability that is comparable to most standardized clinical assessment tools. We find that tractometry is also robust: showing high reliability with different choices of analysis algorithms. Taken together, our results suggest that tractometry is a reliable approach to analysis of white matter connections. The overall approach taken here both demonstrates the specific trustworthiness of tractometry analysis and outlines what researchers can do to establish the reliability of computational analysis pipelines in neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {Background Multi-compartment diffusion models such as Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) have been increasingly used for diffusion MRI (dMRI) data processing in biomedical research. However, those models usually require multiple HARDI shells that may increase scanning duration substantially, and their application can be hindered in uncooperative patients (like infants) accordingly. Also, it is highly expected that the same dataset can be explored with multiple diffusion models for retrieving complementary information. Methods Multiple gradient-encoding schemes which consisted of 4--6 shells, moderate b-values (bmax =1,500 or 2,000 s/mm2), and 32--80 gradient directions were explored. The corresponding time of acquisition (TA) for a single scan ranged from 3 to 8 minutes respectively. The dMRI protocols were tested on macaque monkeys using a 3T clinical setting. The data were analysed using both NODDI and diffusion basic spectrum imaging (DBSI) models. Results The maps of orientation dispersion index (ODI) and CSF were consistent across the 4--6 shell sampling schemes. However, the corresponding intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF) maps showed reduced pixel counts [1,100{\textpm}98 (80 directions) vs. 806{\textpm}70 (32 directions), one slice] in white matter when fewer gradient directions or lower b-value was applied. The hindered diffusion and CSF ratio maps were comparable across these sampling schemes. The maps of restricted diffusion ratio varied across the schemes. However, its mean ratios (0.23{\textpm}0.02 vs. 0.22{\textpm}0.01) and pixel counts (1,540{\textpm}70 vs. 1,510{\textpm}38, one slice) between the schemes of 80 and 32 directions with b=2,000 s/mm2 were comparable. Conclusions The present study reports a fast multi-shell dMRI data acquisition and processing strategy which allows for obtaining complementary information about microstructural alteration and inflammation from a single dMRI data set with both NODDI and DBSI models. The proposed approach may be particularly useful for characterizing the neurodegenerative disorders in uncooperative patients like children or acute stroke patients in which brain injury is associated with inflammation.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Only a handful of studies have investigated the nature, functional significance, and course of white matter abnormalities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during the semi-acute stage of injury. The present study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and compared the accuracy of traditional anatomic scans, neuropsychological testing, and DTI for objectively classifying mTBI patients from controls. Methods: Twenty-two patients with semi-acute mTBI (mean = 12 days postinjury), 21 matched healthy controls, and a larger sample (n = 32) of healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. A subset of participants was examined longitudinally 3--5 months after their initial visit. Results: mTBI patients did not differ from controls on clinical imaging scans or neuropsychological performance, although effect sizes were consistent with literature values. In contrast, mTBI patients demonstrated significantly greater fractional anisotropy as a result of reduced radial diffusivity in the corpus callosum and several left hemisphere tracts. DTI measures were more accurate than traditional clinical measures in classifying patients from controls. Longitudinal data provided preliminary evidence of partial normalization of DTI values in several white matter tracts. Conclusions: Current findings of white matter abnormalities suggest that cytotoxic edema may be present during the semi-acute phase of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Initial mechanical damage to axons disrupts ionic homeostasis and the ratio of intracellular and extracellular water, primarily affecting diffusion perpendicular to axons. Diffusion tensor imaging measurement may have utility for objectively classifying mTBI, and may serve as a potential biomarker of recovery.}

Particular emphasis is placed on the complex differential diagnoses for patients with prolonged postconcussive symptoms. Methods: Select literature review and synthesis. Results: In spite of an increase in public awareness surrounding the acute and potential long-term effects of mTBI, the medical field remains fragmented both in terms of the diagnostic (different criteria proffered by multiple medical organizations) and prognostic factors that influence patient care. Conclusions: Given the lack of objective biomarkers and the spectrum of different disorders that likely encompass mTBI, clinicians are encouraged to adopt a probabilistic, rather than definitive, diagnostic and prognostic framework. The relevance of accurately diagnosing and managing the different manifestations of mTBI becomes clear when one considers the overall incidence of the disorder (42 million people each year worldwide), and the different treatment implications for patients with a true neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., chronic traumatic encephalopathy; rare) vs potentially treatable conditions (e.g., depression or posttraumatic headache; frequent).}

  abstract = {Statistical models employed to test for group differences in quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail to account for the large number of data points per tract in addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73 periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis control participants, we tested for group tract differences and show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these tract differences to investigate their association with performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool for diffusion-weighted analyses.},

  abstract = {In biomedical research, the outcome of longitudinal studies has been traditionally analyzed using the repeated measures analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) or more recently, linear mixed models (LMEMs). Although LMEMs are less restrictive than rm-ANOVA as they can work with unbalanced data and non-constant correlation between observations, both methodologies assume a linear trend in the measured response. It is common in biomedical research that the true trend response is nonlinear and in these cases the linearity assumption of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs can lead to biased estimates and unreliable inference. In contrast, GAMs relax the linearity assumption of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs and allow the data to determine the fit of the model while also permitting incomplete observations and different correlation structures. Therefore, GAMs present an excellent choice to analyze longitudinal data with non-linear trends in the context of biomedical research. This paper summarizes the limitations of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs and uses simulated data to visually show how both methods produce biased estimates when used on data with non-linear trends. We present the basic theory of GAMs and using reported trends of oxygen saturation in tumors, we simulate example longitudinal data (2 treatment groups, 10 subjects per group, 5 repeated measures for each group) to demonstrate their implementation in R. We also show that GAMs are able to produce estimates with non-linear trends even when incomplete observations exist (with 40\% of the simulated observations missing).

Echosounder and physical-oceanographic data were collected in Sendai Bay, Japan, in spring 2005. A hierarchical model was used with two spatial strata: (i) presence and absence of each species; and (ii) biomass density of each species, given its presence; and six environmental covariates (surface water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll, and near-seabed water temperature, salinity, and depth). The results indicate non-linear responses of the two indices to the environmental covariates. In addition, the biomasses estimated by the GAMs were comparable with estimates based on conventional, stratified-random sampling for each species. GAMs are very useful for (i) investigating the effects of environmental factors on the distributions of biological organisms, and (ii) predicting the distributions of animal densities in unsurveyed areas.}

  abstract = {The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the corticospinal tract as important for this classification, correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.},

CytE contributes to brain swelling with a resultant increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). However, questions remain concerning the magnitude of the contribution made by CytE to raised ICP and the ability of CytE by itself to produce lethal levels of ICP that result in brainstem herniation. These questions exist because there are pitfalls in estimating the magnitude of CytE and hence its contribution to ICP using either electron microscopy or in vivo surrogates for CytE such as impedance measurements or the apparent diffusion coefficient. Correlation of these measures has been made during CytE. However, the literature provides reasons to question whether any of these surrogates for CytE can give accurate quantitative measures of CytE. At present, there is little evidence to indicate that CytE can, by itself, raise ICP to lethal levels. However, because CytE can raise ICP, it is of interest to develop treatments to prevent or reduce CytE even though currently available data do not yet provide an established mechanistic basis upon which to base such therapy.}

Some studies have suggested that white matter properties serve as static predictors of academic skills, whereas other studies have observed no such relationship. On the other hand, longitudinal studies have suggested that within-individual changes in the white matter are linked to learning gains over time. In the present study, we look to replicate and extend the previous longitudinal results linking longitudinal changes in the white matter properties of the left arcuate fasciculus to individual differences in reading development. To do so, we analyzed diffusion MRI data, along with reading and mathematics scores in a longitudinal sample of 340 students as they progressed from 1st grade into 4th grade. Longitudinal growth models revealed that year-to-year within-individual changes in reading scores, but not math, were related to the development of the left arcuate fasciculus. These findings provide further evidence linking the dynamics of white matter development and learning in a unique sample and highlight the importance of longitudinal designs.}

Using fluorescence lifetime imaging to analyze contributions of intracellular ionic changes in brain slices, we find that intense Na+ entry triggers a secondary increase in intracellular Cl- that is required for neuronal swelling and death. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated knockdown screening identified the ion exchanger SLC26A11 unexpectedly acting as a voltage-gated Cl- channel that is activated upon neuronal depolarization to membrane potentials lower than -20~mV. Blockade of SLC26A11 activity attenuates both neuronal swelling and cell death. Therefore cytotoxic neuronal edema occurs when sufficient Na+ influx and depolarization is followed by Cl- entry via SLC26A11. The resultant NaCl accumulation causes subsequent~neuronal swelling leading to neuronal death. These findings shed light on unique elements of volume control in excitable cells and lay the ground for the development of specific treatments for brain edema.}

  abstract = {This contribution presents an approach to model individual tree height--diameter relationships for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in multi-size and mixed-species stands in Estonia using the Estonian Permanent Forest Research Plot Network. The dataset includes 22,347 trees. The main focus of the study was to use an approach that is spatially explicit allowing for high accuracy prediction from a minimum set of predictor variables that can be easily derived. Consequently, the height--diameter relationship is modeled as a function of only the stand quadratic mean diameter (dg) and the plot geographical coordinates. A specific generalized additive model gam is employed that allows for the integration of a varying coefficient term and 2-dimensional surface estimators representing a spatial trend and a spatially varying coefficient term. The high flexibility of the model is needed due to the very few predictor variables that subsume a variety of potential influential factors. Subsequently, a linear mixed model is used that quantifies the random variation between plots and between measurement occasions within plots, respectively. Hence, our model is based on the theory of structured additive regression models (Fahrmeir et al. 2007) and separates a structured (correlated) spatial effect from an unstructured (uncorrelated) spatial effect. Additionally, the linear mixed model allows for calibration of the model using height measurements as pre-information. Model bias is small, despite the somewhat irregular distribution of experimental areas within the country. The overall model shows some similarity with earlier applications in Finland. However, there are important differences involving the model form, the predictors and the method of parameter estimation.},

Design Rapid evidence reviews on 12 clinical questions and Delphi method for expert consensus. Participants The Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Brain Injury Special Interest Group convened a Working Group of 17 members and an external interdisciplinary expert panel of 32 clinician-scientists. Public stakeholder feedback was analyzed from 68 individuals and 23 organizations. Results The first 2 Delphi votes asked the expert panel to rate their agreement with both the diagnostic criteria for mild TBI and the supporting evidence statements. In the first round, 10 of 12 evidence statements reached consensus agreement. Revised evidence statements underwent a second round of expert panel voting, where consensus was achieved for all. For the diagnostic criteria, the final agreement rate, after the third vote, was 90.7\%. Public stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the diagnostic criteria revision prior to the third expert panel vote. A terminology question was added to the third round of Delphi voting, where 30 of 32 (93.8\%) expert panel members agreed that `the diagnostic label `concussion' may be used interchangeably with `mild TBI' when neuroimaging is normal or not clinically indicated.' Conclusions New diagnostic criteria for mild TBI were developed through an evidence review and expert consensus process. Having unified diagnostic criteria for mild TBI can improve the quality and consistency of mild TBI research and clinical care.},

  abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used Loess-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the Loess fit (e.g., span width, degree of polynomial). Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike Loess, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter {$\delta$}15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3,000-year alkenone record from Braya-S{\o}, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.}

Restrictions due to privacy or proprietary data as well as more practical concerns can make it hard to share neuroimaging datasets, such that analyzing all data in a common location might be impractical or impossible. Meta-analytic methods provide a way to overcome this issue, by combining aggregated quantities like model parameters or risk ratios. Most meta-analytic tools focus on parametric statistical models, and methods for meta-analyzing semi-parametric models like generalized additive models have not been well developed. Parametric models are often not appropriate in neuroimaging, where for instance age-brain relationships may take forms that are difficult to accurately describe using such models. In this paper we introduce meta-GAM, a method for meta-analysis of generalized additive models which does not require individual participant data, and hence is suitable for increasing statistical power while upholding privacy and other regulatory concerns. We extend previous works by enabling the analysis of multiple model terms as well as multivariate smooth functions. In addition, we show how meta-analytic p-values can be computed for smooth terms. The proposed methods are shown to perform well in simulation experiments, and are demonstrated in a real data analysis on hippocampal volume and self-reported sleep quality data from the Lifebrain consortium. We argue that application of meta-GAM is especially beneficial in lifespan neuroscience and imaging genetics. The methods are implemented in an accompanying R package metagam, which is also demonstrated.},

The introduction covers a range of topics including basis functions, the smoothing penalty, random smooths, difference smooths, smooth interactions, model comparison and autocorrelation. It is divided into two parts. The first part looks at what GAMMs are, how they work and why/when we should use them. Although the reader can replicate some of the example analyses in this section, this is not essential. The second part is a tutorial introduction that illustrates the process of fitting and evaluating GAMMs in the R statistical software environment, and the reader is strongly encouraged to work through the examples on their own machine.},

  abstract = {This article provides a tutorial for analyzing pupillometric data. Pupil dilation has become increasingly popular in psychological and psycholinguistic research as a measure to trace language processing. However, there is no general consensus about procedures to analyze the data, with most studies analyzing extracted features from the pupil dilation data instead of analyzing the pupil dilation trajectories directly. Recent studies have started to apply nonlinear regression and other methods to analyze the pupil dilation trajectories directly, utilizing all available information in the continuously measured signal. This article applies a nonlinear regression analysis, generalized additive mixed modeling, and illustrates how to analyze the full-time course of the pupil dilation signal. The regression analysis is particularly suited for analyzing pupil dilation in the fields of psychological and psycholinguistic research because generalized additive mixed models can include complex nonlinear interactions for investigating the effects of properties of stimuli (e.g., formant frequency) or participants (e.g., working memory score) on the pupil dilation signal. To account for the variation due to participants and items, nonlinear random effects can be included. However, one of the challenges for analyzing time series data is dealing with the autocorrelation in the residuals, which is rather extreme for the pupillary signal. On the basis of simulations, we explain potential causes of this extreme autocorrelation, and on the basis of the experimental data, we show how to reduce their adverse effects, allowing a much more coherent interpretation of pupillary data than possible with feature-based techniques.},

  abstract = {In designed experiments and in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess the effect of a quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a multienvironment agricultural field experiment in which a yield--seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and non-smooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented.}

We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

  abstract = {In phonetics, many datasets are encountered which deal with dynamic data collected over time. Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {The onset of adolescence in humans is marked by hormonal changes that give rise to secondary sexual characteristics, noted as puberty. It has, however, proven challenging to unravel to what extent pubertal changes may have organizing effects on the brain beyond chronological age, as reported in animal studies. The present longitudinal study aimed to characterize the unique effects of age and puberty on subcortical brain volumes and included three waves of data collection at two-year intervals and 680 T1-weighted MRI scans of 271 participants (54\% females) aged between 8 and 29 years old. Generalized additive mixed model procedures were used to assess the effects of age, self-report pubertal status and testosterone level on basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum gray matter volumes. We observed age-related increases in putamen and pallidum volumes, and decreases in accumbens and thalamus volumes, all show larger volumes in boys than girls. Only the cerebellum showed an interaction effect of age by sex, such that males showed prolonged increases in cerebellar volume than females. Next, we showed that changes in self-report puberty status better described developmental change than chronological age for most structures in males, and for caudate, pallidum and hippocampal volumes in females. Furthermore, changes in testosterone level were related to development of pallidum, accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala volumes in males and caudate and hippocampal volumes in females. The modeling approach of the present study allowed us to characterize the complex interactions between chronological age and pubertal maturational changes, and the findings indicate puberty unique changes in brain structure that are sex specific.},

However, normal reference values for CMR-derived morphology parameters have not been established for Chinese children. We sought to establish reference values for ventricular and atrial size and function parameters using CMR in healthy Chinese children across a broad age range. Methods 3-T CMR scans were performed in 191 healthy children, aged 4--18 years. We used balanced steady-state free precession sequence for analyzing chamber size and function. Reference percentile curves and tables were generated using the generalized additive model for location scale and shape. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare our results with those of relevant previously published studies. Results Boys generally had greater ventricular volumes and masses after normalization for body surface area (BSA) compared with girls. However, in the youngest age group (4--8 years), differences in volumes or masses between sexes were not found. Additionally, differences were not observed in left ventricular and right ventricular ejection fractions between sexes upon stratifying subjects based on age groups. However, after normalizing for BSA, only the maximal right atrial volume (RAVmax) remained significantly greater in boys than that in girls. Age-specific and BSA-specific reference curves revealed non-linear relationships between age/BSA and cardiac parameters. Asian children exhibited significantly smaller chamber sizes compared to those seen in Caucasian children. Conclusion We report normative CMR ventricular and atrial volume and function in Chinese children based on BSA, age, and sex, which can serve as a reference for future studies and clinical practice.},

We used an interrupted time-series design and analyzed the concussion data (2005--2016) from High School Reporting Injury Online. We examined the trends of new or recurrent concussion rates among US representative high-school athletes participating in 9 sports across prelaw, immediate-postlaw, and postlaw periods by using general linear models. We defined 1 athlete exposure as attending 1 competition or practice. Results. We included a total of 8043 reported concussions (88.7\% new, 11.3\% recurrent). The average annual concussion rate was 39.8 per 100\,000 athlete exposures. We observed significantly increased trends of reported new and recurrent concussions from the prelaw, through immediate-postlaw, into the postlaw period. However, the recurrent concussion rate showed a significant decline 2.6 years after the laws went into effect. Football exhibited different trends compared with other boys' sports and girls' sports. Conclusions. Observed trends of increased concussion rates are likely attributable to increased identification and reporting. Additional research is needed to evaluate intended long-term impact of traumatic brain injury laws.}

  abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.},
